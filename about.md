I'm a Software Engineer in New York City.  I graduated from Arizona State in 2010 with a B.S. in Computer Science cum laude.  While studying at Arizona State I interned at the Business Department, interned at Honeywell Aerospace's avionics division, and interned with a research laboratory (part of this work [is published](http://www.public.asu.edu/~ychen127/pvldb10_xsact.pdf)).

After graduating I moved on to Wall Street and became a Technology Analyst at Goldman Sachs.  While at Goldman I worked in various aspects of Derivatives trading technology, including back office trade automation, regulatory reform auditing work, and front office algorithmic trading technology.

I currently work for Conductor, Inc., helping build out the Searchlight platform.  While at Conductor I've tackled lots of problems around streaming and optimization.  Part of my work was [open sourced](https://github.com/tdcmeehan/rx-ordered-data/).

I currently work at Bloomberg LP helping develop their portfolio analytics platform.  *To recruiters, I am not willing to consider new job opportunities at this moment.*
