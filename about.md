I'm a Software Engineer in New York City.  I graduated from Arizona State in 2010 with a B.S. in Computer Science cum laude.  While studying at Arizona State I interned at the Business Department, interned at Honeywell Aerospace's avionics division, and interned with a research laboratory (part of this work [is published](http://www.public.asu.edu/~ychen127/pvldb10_xsact.pdf)).

After graduating I moved on to Wall Street and became a Technology Analyst at Goldman Sachs.  While at Goldman I worked in various aspects of Derivatives trading technology, including back office trade automation, regulatory reform auditing work, and front office algorithmic trading technology.

I currently work for Conductor, Inc., helping build out the Searchlight platform.  While at Conductor I've tackled lots of problems around streaming and optimization.  Part of my work is in the process of being [open sourced](https://github.com/Conductor/rx-ordered-data/)--stay tuned, more is on the way!
